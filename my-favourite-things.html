  <h1>My favourite things</h1>
    <p>There are very many things that I enjoy. They are too many to list! but i can name a few. I will group these things into two for now.</p>
    <p>To start us off, I will start with a list of my best friends.</p>
  <h2>My best friends</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Laura Mwangi</li>
        <li>Winnie Njumwa</li>
        <li>Maureen Kosgei</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Each of these individuals mean so much to me. One of them, Winnie, has been my friend since we were in primary school! The other two we met in campus and have been friends since.</p>

    <p>The other group of my favourite things is a group of my favourite foods! I wouldn't necessarily call myself a "foodie", but I have a few foods that can literally turn a bad around! I am going to add a few fruits to the list as well.</p>
  <h2>Favourite foods</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Rice, cooked in whichever style</li>
          <li>Seedless grapes are divine to say the least</li>
          <li>Chicken</li>
          <li>Stir fried vegetables</li>
        </ol>

    <p>To add to the above list, I also enjoy a good book and music. I always have earphones plugged in pretty much all the time. Sleeping should have been first on that list! At least it made it to the list though.</p>
